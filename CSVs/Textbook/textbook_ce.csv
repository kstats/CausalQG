The two weight lifters on the bottom right are both lifting the weight the same distance, but the weight lifter on the left is lifting a heavier weight, so she is doing more work.","The two weight lifters on the left are lifting the same amount of weight , but the one on the bottom is lifting the weight a greater distance",this weight lifter is doing more work .

0,"In physics, work means the use of force to move an object. The teens who are playing basketball in the picture above are using force to move their bodies and the basketball, so they are doing work. The teen who is studying isnt moving anything, so she isnt doing work.",The teens who are playing basketball in the picture above are using force to move their bodies and the basketball,they are doing work .
0,"The teens who are playing basketball in the picture above are using force to move their bodies and the basketball, so they are doing work. The teen who is studying isnt moving anything, so she isnt doing work. Not all force that is used to move an object does work.",The teen who is studying isnt moving anything,she isnt doing work .
15,"For work to be done, the force must be applied in the same direction that the object moves. If a force is applied in a different direction than the object moves, no work is done. The Figure 1.1 illustrates this point.",a force is applied in a different direction than the object moves,no work is done .

80,"A: Regardless of the weight of the box, the man does no work on it as he holds it while walking across the room. However, he does more work when he first lifts a heavier box to chest height.",he holds it while walking across the room .,"Regardless of the weight of the box , the man does no work on it"
