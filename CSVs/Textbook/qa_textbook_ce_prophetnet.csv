When the input force is applied to the wheel, as it is with a doorknob, the axle turns over a shorter distance but with greater force, so the mechanical advantage is greater than 1. This allows you to turn the doorknob with relatively little effort, while the axle of the doorknob applies enough force to slide the bar into or out of the doorframe.","it is with a doorknob , the axle turns over a shorter distance but with greater force","what happens when input force is applied to the wheel ?
