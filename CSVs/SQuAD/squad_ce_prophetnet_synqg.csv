This is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates. For example, friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms, but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector.",macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates,This,"why is it often impossible to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials ?
