This is why, for example, astronauts experience weightlessness when in free-fall orbit around the Earth, and why Newton 's Laws of Motion are more easily discernible in such environments. If an astronaut places an object with mass in mid-air next to himself, it will remain stationary with respect to the astronaut due to its inertia.","Albert Einstein extended the principle of inertia further when he explained that reference frames subject to constant acceleration, such as those free-falling toward a gravitating object, were physically equivalent to inertial reference frames","for example, astronauts experience weightlessness when in free-fall orbit around the Earth, and why Newton 's Laws of Motion are more easily discernible in such environments","why did einstein extend the principle of inertia ?
