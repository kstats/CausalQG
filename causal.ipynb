A wedge is used to cut or split apart objects. Force is applied to the thick end of the wedge, and the wedge, in turn, applies force to the object along both of its sloping sides. This force causes the object to split apart. A knife is another example of a wedge. In the Figure 1.2, a knife is being used to chop tough pecans.
